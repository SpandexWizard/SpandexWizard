Hey there! I'm SpandexWizard! A noaccount couch keyboard contributer. I'm mostly a lurker and I dont do a whole lot yet, but I'm here trying to make the world a better place.

I enjoy open source software and think that community driven content is extremely important to making our future brighter. 

I like games, graphic design, programming, a wild array of arts, and yes I am a total geek. Nice to meet you!
